This is just complete scrap that I pushed to github so that it appeared to people I was doing work,had an active account, etc.

No need to even take a gaze at this horrid, incidental repository.

This is a (random)Lua libary! It converts all the old function dumps in ROBLOX.Lua to simple
and faster to type functions.

Your free to use the old ones, but if you ever are tired of doing
print(string.sub("LOL",1,2)) and just want to do:

sub("LOL",1,2)) then there you go!

Yada, yada wrote this when I was bored and aimlessly writing code in Lua.
