This is a Lua libary! It converts all the old function dumps to simple
and faster to type functions.

Your free to use the old ones...But if you ever are tired of doing
print(string.sub("LOL",1,2)) and just want to do:

sub("LOL",1,2)) then there you go!

It might be a bit buggy. And probably someone already created their own.
